# ENS Domains Bug Bounty - Target Scope

## Target Information
- **URL**: https://ens.domains
- **Program**: Immunefi Bug Bounty
- **Type**: Web Application (Ethereum Name Service)

## In-Scope Vulnerabilities

### Critical Severity
1. Execute arbitrary system commands
2. Subdomain takeover with already-connected wallet interaction
3. Direct theft of user funds
4. Direct theft of user NFTs
5. Injection of malicious HTML or XSS through metadata
6. Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users:
   - Changing registration information
   - Voting
   - Changing ENS records
7. Malicious interactions with already-connected wallet:
   - Modifying transaction arguments/parameters
   - Substituting contract addresses
   - Submitting malicious transactions
8. Changing sensitive transaction details (with up to one click):
   - Registration Timer
   - Cached Transaction History

### High Severity
1. Subdomain takeover without already-connected wallet interaction
2. Changing NFT metadata
3. Persistent HTML injection without JavaScript
4. Arbitrary file uploads
5. Confidential user information disclosure (email, phone, address)
6. Modifying backend/browser state via iframing

### Medium Severity
1. Application/website denial of service
2. Taking down NFT URI
3. Changing non-sensitive user details
4. Reflected HTML injection
5. Loading external site data
6. Open redirect

### Low Severity
1. Taking over broken/expired outgoing links
2. Temporarily disabling user access (cookie bombing, etc.)

## Out of Scope
- Theoretical impacts without PoC
- Physical access attacks
- Local network attacks
- Reflected plain text injection
- Self-XSS
- CAPTCHA bypass without impact
- Logout CSRF
- Missing HTTP headers without impact
- Server-side non-confidential disclosure
- User enumeration
- Normal workflow user actions
- SSL/TLS best practices
- DDoS only
- UI/UX issues
- Browser/plugin defects
- Non-sensitive API key leakage
- Browser bugs for exploitation
- SPF/DMARC misconfiguration
- Automated scanner reports without PoC
- Broken links from archived content

## Key Testing Areas
1. **XSS/HTML Injection**: Metadata fields, user inputs, ENS name display
2. **Subdomain Takeover**: All subdomains of ens.domains
3. **Wallet Interaction**: Transaction modification, parameter tampering
4. **Open Redirect**: URL parameters, redirects
5. **Information Disclosure**: User data leakage
6. **Session/State Management**: Browser storage, cached data
